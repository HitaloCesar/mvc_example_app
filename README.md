While trying to study some architectural patterns, I encountered the challenge of finding didactic tutorials. After grasping the core concepts, I decided to create this post.

Understanding this architectural pattern is not only valuable for practical applications but also acts as a stepping stone for comprehending more complex architectural patterns commonly used in the industry.
